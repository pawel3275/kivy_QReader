# QReader
QR code reader for mobile purposes. Reads QR codes and shows popup with result. Alongside with it generated QR code according to given string, which later can be saved or shared. Implementation focuses mostly on kivy usage.

Due to known issue (https://github.com/kivy/kivy/issues/6919?fbclid=IwAR07u8DgQYadAf4j46eMAkAinq6I-XkuCEegWtiaDVbtkei6BjRF-tlW--4) with camera rotation on android project is supported only on windows. Android workaround with which i came up with is present on branch xcamera_merged_with_opencv (https://github.com/pawel3275/QReader/tree/xcamera_merged_with_opencv)
